a proposed Bayesian computational model that can explain how people comprehend visual narratives that allows viewers to generate typical inferences. The model instantiates aspects of the scene perception & event comprehension theory (SPECT), namely the front‐end (entity extraction) and back‐end (event model construction). The Bayesian model represents causal inferences (particularly bridging inferences) using a description logic containing an ontology of entities and events.  The repository contains the ontology model developed in Protege.
